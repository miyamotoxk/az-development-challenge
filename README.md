# Viveo Group Developer Challenge
This challenge is designed to demonstrate a candidate's abilities across a range of competencies in software development with Typescript. 

There are no right or wrong answers to this challenge, only the solutions _you_ provide. The purpose of this challenge is to give us examples of how you think about and solve problems. 

## Instructions

* Fork the repository
* Create a basic addition and subtraction calculator which implements the following rules:
	* On triggering an `add` action, add 5 to the current total
	* On triggering a `subtract` action, subtract 5 from the current total
	* At any point in time we should be able to see the history of provided additions and subtractions (outputting to the console is fine, but feel free to create a UI implementation)
	* Implement at least three (3) of the demonstratable concepts listed below
* Create a pull request back to this repository with your solution 
	* If you prefer your submission to be private please zip your project and send it through to [christopher@viveogroup.com](mailto:christopher@viveogroup.com), clearly stating that this is a tech test submission.

**NOTE: While Typescript submissions are preferred, ECMAScript submissions will also be accepted. Submissions written in other languages will not be accepted.**

## Grading

* Code cleanliness
* Code reusability
